            <h3>Experience the traditional tastes of Bahawalpur</h3>
            
            <p>Like other cities in southern Punjab, Bahawalpur is known for its Saraiki cuisine with lamb and mutton featuring heavily in recipes. Lamb chops form the basis of Multani Chaamp. The lamb chops are flavoured with spice mixes which vary from home to home or restaurant to restaurant and then placed on skewers and grilled on charcoal barbecues. Also popular, and ideal as a lighter dish that suits all budgets is Painda or Sohbat where a thin tikka masala is served on slices of hot chapatti. If you have a sweet tooth, then try some sohan halwa with your morning coffee, afternoon tea or as a dessert. Water, milk, sugar and cornflour are boiled until solid then ghee, saffron, almonds, cardamom seeds and pistachios are added for texture and flavour.</p>
