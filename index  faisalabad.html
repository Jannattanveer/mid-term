            <h3>The best restaurants in Faisalabad are closer than you think</h3>
            
            <p>Some dyed-in-the-wool foodies never compromise. They travel miles to a restaurant renowned for biryanis (for example). And then travel some more, looking for the perfect falooda to wash it down. <br>

                Even if you’re not the travelling kind, you can still enjoy the culinary delights of the best restaurants in Faisalabad by calling them directly and placing a food order, or by using the foodpanda link (more of that later) to have your favourite dishes sent to <br>
                
                However, with dozens of restaurants, roadside stalls, take-out joints and dhabas spread all over Faisalabad, zeroing in on the ones to patronise might prove a bit of a feat. So why not simply study the following list of tried-and-tested establishments and then decide?</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Grab a bite at the best!</h3>
            
            <p>  ✓ Apple Nine: located in Sitara Mall on the Main Boulevard, this pizza joint has won praise from its patrons for its pizzas, appetizers, salads and jaw-stretching sandwiches. Being spacious, it’s great for parties. <br>
                ✓ McDonald’s: this restaurant chain needs no introduction. The Faisalabad branch offers the usual fare, though it’s a bit pricey. <br>
                ✓ Arabic Pizza Hut: what you can expect here is pizzas with an Arabian accent; more BBQ bits for toppings, for example. <br>
                ✓ Sardines Restaurant: located on Canal Road, this eatery lists many Chinese, North Indian and Mughlai dishes on its menu. Its daily lunch+high tea is its greatest attraction. <br>
                ✓ Quilim Chinese Restaurant: its lush interiors and lavish buffet make Quilim a must-visit place for any serious foodie. <br>
                ✓ Real Taste Restaurant: a popular eating place for those with a passion for Mughlai fare. Large groups must book tables to avoid disappointment. <br>
                ✓ Al Aziz Restaurant: as the name suggests, an eatery focused on Mughlai/Pakistani cuisine. The reshmi kebab and chicken archari are highly recommended. <br>
                ✓ Baba Tikka: this establishment on Canal Road serves mainly Pakistani food. It offers home delivery if orders meet the minimum Rs500 limit and charges Rs100 for delivery</p>
            <br>
